# 42 Web Discovery Piscine ‚Äì Florence

This repository contains the exercises and group projects I completed during the **42 Web Discovery Piscine** at 42 Florence.  
The Piscine is an intensive bootcamp where students explore web development fundamentals through daily exercises and weekend group projects (Rush).  
All work here was completed using only **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and shell scripting**, without external frameworks or templates.
