# Exercise – Random Background Color

## Objective
Create a button that changes the background color of the page to a random color every time it is clicked.

## Files
- `index.html` – contains the button and links to CSS/JS files.
- `background.css` – styles for the button.
- `background.js` – logic to generate random colors and change the background.

## Implementation
1. A `<button>` is placed in the HTML page.
2. On click, the function `myfunction()` is triggered.
3. The function calls `generateColor()` which builds a random HEX color code.
4. The background color of the `body` is updated with the generated color.

## Example
- First click → background turns to `#F2A1C3`
- Second click → background turns to `#34B8FF`
- Each click generates a new random color.

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in your browser and click the button.  
Each click will change the background color to a random HEX value.

## Notes
- Only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used.  
- The random color is generated by combining 6 characters randomly picked from `[0–9, A–F]`.
