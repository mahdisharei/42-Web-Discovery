# Exercise 00 – The basic

## Objective
Create the initial folder structure for the Discovery Piscine using only shell commands.

## Instructions
1. Create a folder named `discovery_piscine` at the root of your home and move inside it.
2. Inside, create a folder called `cell00` and move into it.
3. Inside `cell00`, create a folder `ex00` (leave it empty).
4. From now on:
   - Exercise 00 → `ex00`
   - Exercise 01 → `ex01`
   - Exercise 02 → `ex02`
   - and so on...

⚠️ This exercise must be done using **`mkdir`** and **`cd`** only.

## Example commands
```bash
cd ~
mkdir discovery_piscine
cd discovery_piscine
mkdir cell00
cd cell00
mkdir ex00
